Slides for SS2018 course Statistical Methods for the Analysis of Geospatial Data

To view slides for first class (8 March 2018), clone this repository with the
following command:
```
> git clone https://github.com/ZGIS/geospatial-data-SS2018
```
To demonstrate at the outset that there are always multiple ways to achieve any
desired result, the slides have been generated in two different ways,
corresponding to the two main directories in `./lec1`. The first is
`html-direct`, which contains a direct `.html` encoding of the
[`reveal.js`](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) slides; while the second
uses `reveal.js` rendered through the
[`Rmarkdown`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) language.

You can view the direct `.html` slides by opening
`./lec1/html-direct/index.html`, or the equivalent versions rendered in
`Rmarkdown` by opening `./lec1/rmarkdown/lec1.html`. The two are not identical,
and reveal the trade-offs that often come with simple solutions. Although the
`Rmarkdown` version is notably easier to generate, it lacks the flexibility of
the full `.html` version, and also doesn't look quite as nice.
